    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I finished high school last year and i felt that i needed to associate myself with programming.This because i wanted to know more about what makes our smartphones and video games run.That's why i opted to learn how programming can change the way we interact with the technologies we use daily and can open our eyes to the infinite possibilities of coding. </p>
